This summer has been busy and fruitful for Wenhan. He participated in the Complex Networks Summer School at the University of Oxford, the Computational Social Science Summer School at Huazhong Agricultural University, the Annual Conference of the Asian Social Simulation Association in Wuhan, the Social Simulation Conference 2023 in Glasgow and the Behave ABM Summer School in Brescia, Italy.

The University of Oxford's Complex Networks Summer School provides the best learning opportunities about the development of complex network science. Participants can gain the latest perspectives and knowledge on theories and applications in this field. At the same time, the summer school brought together nearly a hundred graduate students from different academic backgrounds around the world, which also formed a meaningful academic network. In this summer school, Wenhan established links with researchers from UCL CASA, University of Bristol, IAB Germany, and University of Hannover.

The Computational Social Science Summer School and the Annual Conference of the Asian Social Simulation Society (ASSA) held at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan are important events in the Asian computational social science community. ABM is the main method that ASSA focuses on. Wenhan and researchers from Fudan University, Renmin University of China, Ningxia University, and Northwest A&F University completed a report titled "Agent-based Model of Climate-induced Migration" and was shortlisted for ASSA "Best Student Posters".

The Social Simulation Conference (SSC) is a globally influential ABM event organized by the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA). Wenhan reported a study titled "Modeling Response to Urban Planning (MRUP): From GIS and ABM to Planning Support System" at SSC. This is Wenhanâ€™s summary of his previous ABM-related work. Wenhan had in-depth exchanges with scholars from the University of Groningen and the University of Augsburg.

Behave School in Italy is an internationally renowned ABM education organization. It is based on the Behave Laboratory of the University of Milan. Through this summer school, Wenhan deepened his understanding of ABM methods and theories, acquired some NetLogo modeling skills, and had extensive exchanges with students from the UK, the Netherlands, and Spain with different academic backgrounds.
