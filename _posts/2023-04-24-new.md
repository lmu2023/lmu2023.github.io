The Congress of European Geosciences Union (EGU) 2023 started on Monday April 24, 2023 at the Austria Center, Vienna. Dr. Emlyn Yang and Wenhan Feng attended the conference and presented research results.

Emlyn chaired the session NH9.11 “Future climate risk and adaptation in coastal cities” in the afternoon on Monday April 24, 2023. The session is also a major event of the DECIDER project (www.decider-project.org), where the project partners in Germany and Vietnam met together in person after the pandemic. The session has 7 poster presentations and 9 oral talks in a line. Emlyn presented a poster on his ongoing study about clustering household profiles regarding their flood response measures. The oral part attracted over 80 participants and covered topics of costal risks and adaptations in southeast Asia, China, Europe as well as at global scale. The session ended with a discussion slot moderated by Prof. Volker Hochschild, which encouraged exchanges on future scenarios of costal flood risks as well as plausible adaptation pathways and their transferences to different regions. The entire session finished after 4.5 hours, and some speakers gathered informally again in the evening to continue conversations.

Emlyn also took part in a few talks in other sessions on Tuesday 25.04.2023.

Wenhan presented his study on agent-based model on Thursday afternoon. His model simulated the dynamics of knowledge on collaborative networks, thereby exploring the possibility of coupling ABM and SNA methods.
