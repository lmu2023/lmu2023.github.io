On July 28, 2025, Stories members took part in the LMU Munich–Tongji University Academic Workshop on Urban Climate Resilience and Sustainable Development under Carbon Neutrality Goals, hosted by Prof. Ru Guo (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University). The workshop gathered faculty and students from Tongji’s College of Environmental Science, College of Civil Engineering, and the Institute for Carbon Neutrality. 

Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang and Dr. Anne von Streit presented keynote speeches. PhD students Wenhan Feng, Annika Schubert, Thanh Phuoc Ho, Anqi, and Hao Su presented their ongoing research and exchanged ideas with PhD, Master’s, and undergraduate students from Tongji University. The workshop fostered lively discussions on cross-scale climate adaptation, green development pathways, and the role of young researchers in advancing sustainability science.

Through these academic exchanges, the Stories team strengthened cross-institutional collaboration, fostered dialogue between Chinese and German scholars, and contributed to advancing international research on resilience and sustainable urban development.
