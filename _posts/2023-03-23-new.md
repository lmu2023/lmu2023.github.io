The European Research Council Executive Agency (ERCEA) was organizing a training conference for ERC Principle Investigators in collaboration with the German National Contact Point and the Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main. This conference was held on Thursday, 23 March 2023 from 09:00 am to 5:00 pm, in Frankfurt am Main. Dr. Emlyn Yang attended the meeting.

Given the high interest of participants for various topics, the agenda was filled with multiple presentations on different topics. It started with introduction of contractual rights and obligations of the Principal Investigators, and the differences under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe. The other presentations cover ethics issues, scientific reports, financial reports, as well as the structure of the Proof of Concept grants.

Over 100 ERC project PIs attended the meeting and discussed various project management issues with each other and with the ERCEA officers.
