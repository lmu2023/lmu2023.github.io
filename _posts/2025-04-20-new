title: Highlights of the fieldwork and workshop in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta
---

Building on the success of the first field trip in November 2024, Prof. Matthias Garschagen, Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, and Mr. Thanh Phuoc Ho from LMU Munich visited the Research Institute for Climate Change (DRAGON-Mekong) at Can Tho University in March 2025. The LMU and DRAGON-Mekong teams held a productive discussion meeting and conducted a household survey.

**Surveyor Training and Research Collaboration**

Thanh Phuoc Ho and Dr. Ly Trung Nguyen, leader of the survey team, conducted an intensive, full-day training session for surveyors on November 10, 2024. This training was designed to ensure the team’s preparedness for fieldwork by covering critical aspects such as the survey’s objectives, the questionnaire’s structure, and detailed implementation plans. Participants gained a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities, equipping them to collect high-quality data effectively.

On November 11, 2024, Dr. Emlyn Yang, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Van Pham Dang Tri, and the research team convened for an internal meeting to finalize plans for fieldwork and surveys scheduled for November–December 2024 and March 2025. This collaborative session provided an opportunity for researchers to exchange insights, harmonize approaches, and discuss a roadmap for short-term and long-term collaborations extending through 2028. Later in the day, the team embarked on a field excursion to key flood-control infrastructure in Can Tho City, including the tidal barrier system, Cai Khe dock lock, Ninh Kieu pumping station, and the temporary flood protection system at Ninh Kieu Port. Visits to these sites, along with the An Khanh residential area, offered invaluable insights into the city’s flood adaptation strategies. These firsthand observations will inform upcoming surveys and research activities. The day concluded with a group dinner, fostering camaraderie and teamwork among participants.

**Workshop with Government Representatives**

A formal kick-off workshop was held on 12 November 2024 to prepare for the STORIES Project’s fieldwork and household surveys in the Mekong Delta. Bringing together government representatives, researchers, and local stakeholders, the workshop provided a platform to discuss flooding challenges, community awareness, adaptive capacities, and gaps in current flood management policies.
-	Opening Remarks: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Van Pham Dang Tri welcomed participants, highlighting the workshop’s significance in addressing the region’s pressing flood resilience challenges. Following this, Dr. Emlyn Yang introduced the STORIES Project, outlining its objectives and collaborative activities aimed at enhancing resilience in vulnerable regions.
-	Regional Insights: Representatives from An Giang, Soc Trang, and Ca Mau provinces, as well as Can Tho City, shared detailed accounts of flooding in their respective regions. These presentations covered local flood management practices, community responses, and emerging risks, offering a holistic view of the challenges faced by the Mekong Delta.
-	Project Updates: Dr. Yang presented findings from prior surveys conducted in upstream regions of the Mekong River, while Dr. Nguyen elaborated on the methodologies and applications for the upcoming household surveys in Vietnam. Additionally, Thanh Phuoc Ho shared innovative approaches for assessing and modeling flood resilience, providing a comprehensive overview of the project’s methods.
The workshop concluded with an enriched understanding of the regional context, enabling the STORIES Project team to refine their fieldwork strategies and enhance collaboration with local stakeholders.

**Household Surveys in Can Tho City**

The STORIES Project team commenced household surveys in An Khanh Ward, Ninh Kieu District on November 13, 2024, before expanding to O Mon District. Over ten days, 296 responses were collected, covering diverse urban and semi-urban settings. Surveyors engaged with residents to explore their lifestyles, flood adaptation strategies, and resilience measures. Local officials guided researchers to key areas impacted by flooding, showcasing both structural and community-led adaptation measures. These interactions provided the team with comprehensive data and invaluable contextual insights into the challenges faced by local populations.

**Upcoming Surveys in An Giang and Soc Trang Provinces**

The STORIES Project will continue household surveys in An Giang and Soc Trang in December 2024 and March 2025. These provinces represent diverse flood resilience approaches, for example, *An Giang Province* emphasizes structural measures such as ring dike systems to protect agricultural land. While *Soc Trang province* focuses on non-structural strategies, including community-based initiatives and adaptive farming practices, which enhance resilience to seasonal floods. The upcoming surveys aim to capture these complementary perspectives, contributing to a nuanced understanding of flood resilience in the Mekong Delta.
The STORIES Project’s activities in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta mark a significant step toward addressing the region’s flooding challenges. By combining cutting-edge research methods with local expertise, the project is generating actionable insights to inform policy and practice. As the project progresses, the data collected will be instrumental in shaping sustainable flood resilience strategies for the Mekong Delta and beyond. Through its collaborative and innovative approach, the STORIES Project underscores its commitment to fostering stronger, more adaptive communities in the face of climate change and flooding.
