We are delighted to announce the International Climate Resilience Conference, which will take place on the 26th to 29th October 2025. The conference will be hosted at the Ludwig-Maximillians-University Munich (LMU), located in the heart of one of Europe’s most vibrant cities.

Climate change research has been dominated by warning about risks, vulnerabilities, and damages, often overlooking the significant efforts made by human systems to build and sustain resilience. This conference addresses the gap by highlighting the achievements, progress, and innovative solutions in climate resilience, emphasizing successful strategies, best practices, and achievable potentials that enable communities, organizations, and governments to thrive amid climate impacts.

The conference will bring together leading academics and emerging scholars to discuss the latest research in the scientific field of climate resilience. It also welcomes policymakers, practitioners, and community leaders to share strategies and innovations in real-world settings. The conference aims to provide a platform for collaboration on climate resilience studies, to establish a community for resilience researchers, and to promote a resilience thinking instead of risk thinking in the narrative of climate change.

Sessions There are 16 sessions in the conference, covering many of the most dynamic and promising directions in climate resilience research! The Call for Abstracts opened on 22 April 2025, with a submission deadline of 30 May 2025.
