title: In July 2025, the Stories team participated in and shared research at academic forums hosted by Zhejiang University
---
On July 24, 2025, participants from Stories joined the Zhejiang Universityâ€“LMU Munich Academic Exchange Forum on Resilient Spatial Planning, jointly convened by Prof. Yonghua Li (Department of Regional and Urban Planning, College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University) and Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, and chaired by Dr. Yuting Xie (Institute of Landscape Architecture, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University).

At this forum, Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang presented on the spatial-temporal dynamics of flood resilience in the Mekong River Basin; Wenhan Feng introduced a modeling study on urban planning contributions to flood resilience under SSP scenarios; Thanh Phuoc Ho shared a Bayesian network analysis of interactions among flood resilience measures in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta; Anqi Zhu shared an agent-based model of governance networks and community flood resilience in the Pearl River Delta, China. Additionally, Dr. Anne von Streit and Annika Schubert presented findings from the KARE Project, further expanding the interdisciplinary discussion. 

These exchanges not only highlighted cutting-edge research in resilient spatial planning but also underscored the critical value of interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-border partnerships in addressing climate change and urban risks.
