The International Workshop on Climate-Resilient Development in Southeast Asia, hosted by Harvard's China Project and co-convened with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and LMU Munich's STORIES Project, concluded on July 27, 2024. The event brought together researchers, policymakers, and experts to discuss climate resilience challenges and strategies for Southeast Asia. Topics ranged from resilience theories to sector-specific case studies in agriculture, energy, water, and health. The workshop fostered cross-disciplinary collaboration, advancing practical approaches to climate adaptation in vulnerable regions.

The two-day workshop featured 29 oral presentations and 17 poster displays, bringing together scholars from around the world and fostering productive discussions. Topics spanned Climate Resilience for Health and Well-being, Coastal and Flood Resilience, Urban and Community Resilience, and more. Prof. Chris Nielsen from Harvard University and LMU Munich Vice President Prof. Francesca Biagini delivered the welcome addresses, setting a positive tone. A panel discussion included Professors Michael McElroy (Harvard SEAS), Vincenzo Bollettino (Harvard HHI & HSPH), Le Viet Phu (Fulbright University Vietnam), and Maria Carinnes P. Alejandria (Universiti Brunei Darussalam), who discussed key research questions and future outlooks, offering valuable insights and sparking engaging exchanges. The event concluded with an optimistic outlook from Prof. Nielsen and Dr. Emlyn Yang, ensuring future collaboration.

The results of the workshop are expected to lead to the formation of two special issues, to be published in high-impact peer-reviewed journals. Related work is currently underway.

PhD student Wenhan Feng from the STORIES project participated in the workshop and presented a poster.
