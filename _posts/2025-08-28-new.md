title: Bangkok conference spotlights resilience studies in STORIES
---
Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang attended the conference “Global Leadership in Social Business Innovation: Sustainability, Science and Technology, and Entrepreneurship” which was organized by the Chulalongkorn University on 28-29 August 2025.

This event, which marked the inaugural convening of Chulalongkorn University’s Yunus Center, featured more than 18 expert-led panels and keynote sessions exploring themes such as AI, climate, fintech, and social innovation. Distinguished speakers included Nobel Peace Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus via video message, emphasizing the “Three Zero” approach to social business; alongside leaders from the Yunus Centre, Grameen Bank, SEI, and other global institutions.

Dr. Yang’s dynamic engagement in the conference spanned multiple thematic panels. He served as discussant in:
  •	Panel 3: Climate Finance, where he engaged with speakers from the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) on innovative climate financing.
  •	Panel 8: Urban Resilience, contributing expert insights into the intersections of infrastructure adaptation and socio-economic equity.
  •	Panel 15: Interdisciplinary Management for Social Sustainability, helping shape multidisciplinary strategies for equitable and resilient urban futures.

Additionally, Dr. Yang presented original research in:
  •	Panel 11: Disaster Management and Social Business, which spotlighted pathways to integrate social business principles into crisis response and recovery.
  •	Panel 12: Climate Change and Sustainability, where he showcased the ERC-funded STORIES project on flood resilience across the Mekong Basin, underscoring how basin-scale resilience enhances local and regional adaptation strategies.

Through these efforts, he amplified the reach of the STORIES project, drawing attention to cross-boundary flood resilience within the Mekong context.

Beyond the conference halls, Dr. Yang's visit bore fruits in academic networking and collaboration. He presented a seminar at the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), engaging researchers and students on the themes of flood resilience, urban adaptation, and climate strategies. A short meeting between Dr Yang and Prof. Wijitbusaba Marome (Ann) was taken in the Thammasat University, where both sides identified opportunities to develop joint research on urban resilience in Southeast Asia countries. At Chulalongkorn University, he met with faculty and students from the Social Research Institute, Sustainable Environment Research Institute, and Energy Research Institute to discuss research, teaching, and collaborative opportunities across the Lancang–Mekong region and globally.

Dr. Yang received warm interest from Chulalongkorn academics. Multiple professors expressed enthusiasm for joint research and joint course developments, with specific collaborative proposals anticipated in the coming months and into 2026.

In sum, Dr. Yang’s multi-faceted involvement—from panel leadership and research presentation to academic outreach—illustrates a robust commitment to integrating resilience research with social business innovation in Southeast Asia. His contributions not only advanced understanding of flood resilience in the Mekong Basin but also strengthened global academic partnerships fostering sustainable, interdisciplinary solutions.
