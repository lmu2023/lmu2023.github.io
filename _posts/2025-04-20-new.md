title: Highlights of the fieldwork and workshop in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta
---

Building on the success of the first field trip in November 2024, Prof. Matthias Garschagen, Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, and Mr. Thanh Phuoc Ho from LMU Munich visited the Research Institute for Climate Change (DRAGON-Mekong) at Can Tho University in March 2025. The LMU and DRAGON-Mekong teams held a productive discussion meeting and conducted a household survey.

**Discussion meeting on “Research related to flood issues and modeling applications in flood management”**

On 21 March 2025, a focused discussion meeting on flood-related research and modeling took place between LMU Munich and DRAGON-Mekong at Can Tho University. Prof. Matthias Garschagen, Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, and Mr. Thanh Phuoc Ho presented global perspectives on climate adaptation, while Dr. Dinh Diep Anh Tuan and Dr. Vo Quoc Thanh contributed valuable insights into local flood management practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta.
The discussion fostered meaningful academic exchange, with engaging discussions that helped refine common research goals and identify opportunities for joint initiatives. It represented a significant step toward aligning scientific efforts to support sustainable development and climate resilience in the region.
The meeting concluded with a friendly lunch, offering a relaxed space for continued conversation and deeper connection among researchers.

**Household Surveys in Soc Trang Province**

Mr. Ho and the DRAGON-Mekong team continued the fieldwork in Soc Trang city and My Tu district from 24 March 2025. The team conducted household surveys to better understand local lifestyles, flood adaptation strategies, and community resilience. With support from local officials, the team visited key flood-prone areas and observed both structural and community-led adaptation measures in recent years.

**Contribution of the research to the Vietnamese Mekong Delta**

The STORIES Project’s activities in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta mark a significant step toward addressing the region’s flooding challenges. By combining cutting-edge research methods with local expertise, the project is generating actionable insights to inform policy and practice. As the project progresses, the data collected will be instrumental in shaping sustainable flood resilience strategies for the Mekong Delta and beyond. Through its collaborative and innovative approach, the STORIES Project underscores its commitment to fostering stronger, more adaptive communities in the face of climate change and flooding.
The STORIES Project will continue household surveys in An Giang and Soc Trang in December 2024 and March 2025. These provinces represent diverse flood resilience approaches, for example, *An Giang Province* emphasizes structural measures such as ring dike systems to protect agricultural land. While *Soc Trang province* focuses on non-structural strategies, including community-based initiatives and adaptive farming practices, which enhance resilience to seasonal floods. The upcoming surveys aim to capture these complementary perspectives, contributing to a nuanced understanding of flood resilience in the Mekong Delta.
