---

From 27 April to 2 May 2025, the STORIES project members Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, Ms. Anqi Zhu, Mr. Wenhan Feng, Mr. Thanh Phuoc Ho and Mr. Hao Su from LMU Munich actively participated in the European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly in Vienna, Austria. This event is one of the premier global gatherings for geoscientists, particularly in the field of climate resilience.

**Splinter Meeting SPM73: Climate Resilience Collective Assessment**

Held on Monday, 28 April 2025, from 16:00 to 18:00, this Splinter Meeting focused on the collective assessment of achievements and progress in climate resilience. The meeting addressed several critical issues, beginning with planning the team structure, including co-chairs, working group leaders, budget, and the activity roadmap, and outlining alternative submission plans for the COST proposal.
Attendees strategized on joint research and publication planning, emphasizing role assignments and task coordination. Preparations were also reviewed regarding the upcoming International Climate Resilience Conference at LMU Munich, scheduled for 26–29 October 2025. The team explored funding opportunities for joint projects, conferences, and training schools. They also brainstormed ways to strengthen research community infrastructure, such as formalizing the Google Group on Climate Resilience.
The meeting concluded with a collegial dinner at Inn Reinthaler, fostering deeper connections among participants.

**NH9.10 Session: Enhancing Social Resilience to Climate Change**

Convened by Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, with co-conveners Phuoc Thanh Ho, Margreth Keiler, Feng Mao, and Matthias Garschagen, this well-attended session featured over 30 participants. It included 10 oral presentations and 8 poster presentations, all centered on the theme of social resilience in the face of climate change.
