title: STORIES member in the Summer School on “Agent-Based Modelling” in Brescia, Italy
---

From September 1 to September 12, 2025, PhD candidate Phuoc Thanh Ho had the opportunity to participate in the BEHAVE Summer School on “Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)” at Università Degli Studi Di Brescia in Brescia, Italy. This prestigious program was moderated by leading ABM experts from world-renowned institutions, including the University of Milan and the University of Oxford.

During the intensive summer school, Thanh gained advanced knowledge and hands-on skills in ABM, strengthened his methodological foundation for upcoming research, explored practical modeling frameworks and simulation design techniques, and learned to work with state-of-the-art ABM tools used in environmental and socio-economic systems.

One of the highlights of the program was Thanh’s presentation of his research concept, “Flood Resilience Modeling Using Agent-Based Modelling.” He presented his early-stage ideas to professors and ABM specialists, received constructive academic feedback, gained technical recommendations to refine his modeling framework, and built a solid foundation for developing the simulation model for his upcoming journal paper.

Beyond the classroom, Thanh also participated in various social dinners and academic networking events, where he exchanged research experiences with professors and fellows, discussed methodological challenges and interdisciplinary approaches, and fostered international academic connections for future collaboration.

The BEHAVE Summer School marked a significant milestone in Thanh’s PhD journey, equipping him with valuable expertise, academic insights, and professional relationships essential for advancing his research on flood resilience.
