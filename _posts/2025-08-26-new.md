title: STORIES member in the 20th Annual Social Simulation Conference (SSC 2025), Delft University of Technology
---
From 25–29 August 2025, Ms. Anqi Zhu attended the 20th Annual Social Simulation Conference (SSC 2025) at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), the Netherlands. Organized by the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA), the conference is one of the leading international events in the field of social simulation. This year’s special theme was “Social Simulation in a Socio-Technical Context: Embracing Societies’ Complexities.”

Anqi delivered a short talk on Generative Agent-Based Modeling for Flood Resilience, a project jointly developed by Stories team members Wenhan Feng, Thanh Phuoc Ho, Hao Su, Anqi Zhu, Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, and researchers from the Center for Information and Language Processing, LMU Munich. The presentation, combining large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM), attracted an audience of around 60–70 participants. It sparked lively discussions and generated valuable suggestions.

She also presented a poster entitled Agent-Based Modeling of Governance Networks and Community Flood Resilience in Urban China: The Case of Guangzhou. During the poster session, Anqi engaged in extensive discussions with ABM modelers and demonstrated the model directly on her computer. The work was recognized as addressing a key challenge in simulating institutions within ABM. The poster received strong positive feedback and led to conversations on simulating stakeholder interactions, measuring resilience and future plans.

She attended keynote lectures by Prof. Catholijn Jonker, Prof. Corinna Elsenbroich, Prof. Bill Rand, and Prof. Igor Nikolic, which offered inspiring perspectives on the future of social simulation. In addition, Anqi participated in the workshop Ethnographic Methods and Social Simulations, where she exchanged insights with researchers from Germany and Poland on integrating ethnographic fieldwork into ABM design.

Beyond formal sessions, Anqi engaged in networking with researchers from the University of Groningen, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), and TU Delft, building new connections across disciplines. A special highlight was meeting again with Prof. Andreas Flache and Dr. Teng Li from the University of Groningen, who had been instructors at the 2023 ABM Summer School Anqi attended. This encounter symbolized the continuity of knowledge transfer within the ABM community.
