title: "Resilience Rising: iCARE25 Concludes Successfully in Munich with the Launch of the Munich Climate Resilience Initiative (MCRI)"
---
The International Climate Resilience Conference 2025 (iCARE25) concluded successfully this week at the Catholic Academy in Bavaria (Kardinal-Wendel-Haus) in Munich. Over the three inspiring days, from 27 to 29 October, the event brought together more than 240 participants from over 40 countries — including leading scientists, young researchers, policymakers, and practitioners — all united by one goal: to advance global knowledge, collaboration, and action on climate resilience.

Hosted by the Department of Geography at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich (LMU) (Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang and Prof. Matthias Garschagen) and co-organized with Tsinghua University (Prof. Haifeng Jia), the conference created a vibrant, interdisciplinary platform for dialogue, exchange, and joint reflection. Participants shared the latest scientific progress, innovative practices, and actionable insights that can help societies, ecosystems, and institutions adapt, recover, and transform in the face of growing climate challenges.

**A Timely Forum for Resilience in a Changing World**

In an era when public discourse on climate change is often dominated by risk, loss, and damage, the iCARE25 conference sought to highlight the achievements, progress, and potential in building resilience. The event was guided by a clear vision: to shift the narrative from risk to resilience — from warning about threats to showcasing solutions and inspiring hope.

The conference featured 17 thematic sessions, each focusing on a key dimension of resilience, ranging from health systems, water and coastal resilience, and resilient urbanization, to AI and big data methodologies, resilience governance, social resilience in the past, natural resource resilience, as well as interdisciplinary explorations. Each session was convened by experts from multiple institutions and disciplines, fostering deep interdisciplinary engagement.

The program included more than 180 oral and poster presentations. Topics ranged from advanced modeling tools and policy innovations to participatory approaches that empower communities and local governments. Many presenters underscored the importance of integrating social, technical, and ecological perspectives — a hallmark of the “resilience thinking” approach that iCARE champions.

**Inspiring Keynotes and Global Perspectives**

The conference opened with welcoming remarks by Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, the conference chair from LMU Munich, who emphasized the importance of collaboration and optimism in resilience research:

“Resilience is not only about surviving disturbances; it is about transforming adversity into opportunity and strengthening our collective capacity to thrive in a changing world.”

The opening keynote was delivered by Prof. Mark Pelling (University College London), a globally recognized expert on climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Drawing on decades of research and field experience, Prof. Pelling discussed the evolution of resilience from a theoretical concept to a transformative framework linking science, policy, and practice.

“Resilience is no longer a passive condition but an active process — built through partnerships, trust, and long-term learning,” he noted.

Other keynote lectures included Prof. Margreth Keiler (University of Innsbruck and the Austrian Academy of Sciences), who spoke on resilience and risk management in mountain regions under global change, and Dr. Shankar Deshpande (Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, India), who shared practical insights from urban resilience planning in rapidly growing cities.
The conference closed with an inspiring address by Prof. Tina Comes (TU Delft), titled “Beyond Disaster Response: Resilience Across Time and Space”, which called for connecting short-term crisis management with long-term adaptation and transformation.

**The Launch of the Munich Climate Resilience Initiative (MCRI)**

A central highlight of iCARE25 was the launch of the Munich Climate Resilience Initiative (MCRI) during the Closing Plenary on 29 October. Developed collaboratively through an open and participatory process, the MCRI embodies the shared commitment of the conference community to advancing global resilience research and practice.

Before and during the conference days, participants actively contributed to the MCRI draft through a shared online document, shaping it into a joint declaration that reflects diverse global perspectives. The final version of the Initiative was adopted by acclamation at the Closing Plenary.

The MCRI calls for strengthened cooperation between science, policy, and society to accelerate resilience-building at multiple scales — from local communities to global institutions. It emphasizes four main priorities:

- Advancing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research to better understand complex, multi-hazard resilience mechanisms.
- Co-producing actionable knowledge by engaging policymakers, practitioners, and communities in the design and implementation of resilience strategies.
- Ensuring equity and justice as core principles in resilience planning, giving voice to vulnerable and marginalized groups.
- Building capacity and partnerships that translate scientific insights into transformative solutions for climate-resilient development.

“This initiative symbolizes the shared will of a truly global community,” said Dr. Emlyn Yang. “The Munich Climate Resilience Initiative is not just a statement — it’s a commitment to continue working together, beyond this conference, toward a world where resilience thinking becomes central to both research and practice.”

The MCRI will be published on the conference website (www.climateresilience.info) as an open, living document and will serve as a foundation for future collaboration between researchers, institutions, and policy networks.

**Celebrating Young Researchers and Global Collaboration**

To encourage excellence and recognize emerging talent, the conference introduced three distinctions of awards. All participants are involved in the evaluation process, underscoring the conference’s collective spirit and mentorship ethos.

- Best Presentation Award was presented to Annika Schubert (LMU Munich, Germany), Aravindh Panikkaveettil (Christ University, India), Mauricio Carvallo Aceves (University of British Columbia, Canada), Joshua Nicholas (University of Cambridge, UK), and Blal Adem Esmail (GLOMOS, Eurac Research, Italy).
- Best Poster Award was presented to Maren Jabs (University of Twente, Netherland), Dritan Rustja (University of Shkoder, Albania), and Siying Chen (LMU Munich, Germany)
- Excellent Young Researcher Award was presented to Dr. Dipesh Chapagain (UNU-EHS, Germany & IIASA, Austria), Kristina Wolf (Newcastle University, UK) and Sungju Han (Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ, Germany).

Participants particularly appreciated the open and supportive atmosphere that allowed for genuine dialogue across disciplines, regions, and generations.

**Looking Forward: A Global Community of Resilience Thinkers**

Beyond academic discussions, iCARE25 succeeded in creating a strong sense of community. Participants emphasized the inclusive and collaborative environment, which bridged diverse disciplines — from hydrology, ecology, and engineering to sociology, political science, and history. The conference also featured poster sessions, informal networking events, and a closing reception celebrating shared achievements.

The media coverage of iCARE25, including interviews with the participants (Prof. Tina Comes, Prof. Matthias Garschagen, Prof. Jürgen Scheffran, etc.) and reports by journalists from ARD, BR, Germany Broadcast, and university media, further amplified the conference’s message of hope and action.

As the event concluded, participants expressed optimism and renewed energy. “The iCARE conference is more than a meeting — it’s a movement,” said one participant from the Global South. “It gives us a vision of how science can empower resilience through cooperation, not competition.”

**A Milestone for Resilience Research**

With its successful conclusion, the International Climate Resilience Conference 2025 marks a milestone in advancing interdisciplinary and solution-oriented research on climate resilience. It demonstrated that resilience is not an abstract idea but a tangible, evolving practice — built collectively through science, solidarity, and shared commitment.

As the MCRI now takes shape, the spirit of iCARE25 will continue — inspiring future research, policy dialogue, and transformative actions for a resilient planet.

“Resilience rises through collaboration,” concluded Dr. Emlyn Yang. “Munich has set a strong foundation for a global alliance of knowledge and action — a community that will continue to learn, adapt, and thrive together.”
