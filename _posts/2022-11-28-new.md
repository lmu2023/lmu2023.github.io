The Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t Munich (LMU) is one of the largest and most renowned universities in Germany. The Chair in Human Geography at the Department of Geography offers a PhD student position and a postdoctoral researcher position to support the research activities in the context of the European Research Council (ERC) project STORIES (ID: 101040939), led by Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang. This is a 5-year research project funded with 1.5M Euro that will investigate the dynamic interactions of floods impacts and social resilience in the Mekong River basin. Based on the project, a small team will be established to do pioneering and impactful science on climate resilience. www.erc-stories.com

What we offer:
A PhD student position at 75% working time, starting from April 01, 2023 and lasting for 3 years. Remuneration will be according to the German TV-L scheme at the E13 Level.A full time postdoc researcher position with an initial appointment of 1 year.

Tasks and responsibilities:
The PhD student will carry out case studies at the upstream of Mekong River (Lancang River), particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan of China. This includes implementation of field investigation, household surveys, expert interviews, local workshops, and data collections from various sources. The PhD study shall explore flood resilience based on the case studies, by applying Agent-Based Model and/or Social Network Analysis under supervision.
The postdoc researcher will concentrate on methodological development of Agent-Based Model and/or Social Network Analysis for studying flood resilience, using case studies at the Mekong basin and also beyond. The researcher will take a leading role in the development of scientific publications, organizing and supporting various activities of the project, and co-supervising junior researchers in the project team. The researcher will also contribute to developing new research proposals in the broader field of climate resilience studies.

Required qualifications and experiences:
Masters degree is required to start the PhD study, with an education background in geography or a related discipline such as spatial planning, environmental studies, hydrology, geo-informatics sciences, sociology or development studies.
The postdoc researcher must have a strong publication track-record in any research fields that are closely related to flood resilience or climate resilience studies. Strong skills and experiences in developing Agent-Based Model and/or Social Network Analysis are prerequisite.
For both positions, willingness to travel for work (field investigations, project meetings, workshops etc.) in China, Vietnam, and other Mekong basin areas is necessary. Proven skills in qualitative as well as quantitative social science research methods are required. Strong skills in project management, workshop moderation and organization are required. Excellent English language skill (written and oral) is prerequisite.

Additional assets of interest for both positions:
Expertise in mathematics, statistics, modelling and/or programming (e.g. R, Netlogo, Matlab, Python)
