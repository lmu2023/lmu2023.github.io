<p>
The STORIES team is committed to and contributing to diverse activities in advancing climate resilience studies (not only on flood resilience).
The ‘<b>ResilienceHub</b>’ is established to combine and promote these activities, which currently involve, e.g., creating and managing the Google Group and WeChat group, editing newsletters, organizing webinars, convening scientific workshop and conferences, and cooperating in research projects.

<h3>Google Group “Climate Resilience”</h3>


<p>
  Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang created the “Climate Resilience” group in Google Groups in January 2021. It has since then kept a fast growth to recently a group of over 1500 members globally. The group is a vibrant platform to share information, opinion, and resources related to climate resilience across the globe. Jointly with the group members, we are now a very active and dynamic network committed to climate resilience studies.
  <br>Since communications and messages are increasing quickly in the group, existed materials can be soon submerged by new inputs. A Climate Resilience Newsletter is therefore edited to collect and archive the communicated contents in the group. The newsletters are freely accessible on internet via the below link to Google Drive.
  <br>Everyone with an email account can request to join the group. New members’ posts are moderated before being distributed to the entire group. Inquires shall be sent to

<h3>WeChat Group “Climate Resilience” (气候韧性微信群)</h3>

<p>
  Dr. Liang Emlyn Yang, jointly with Dr. Feng Mao (毛丰，University of Warwick, UK) and Dr. Wei Liu (刘伟，Luohan Academy, Alibaba, China), created the “Climate Resilience” group in WeChat in September 2019. Communications in the WeChat group are mainly in Chinese. The group has attracted 651 members by June 20, 2023. Discussions happen frequently and are in chat-style. Members are active in sharing relevant publications, jobs, conference information, as well as discussing interesting questions.
  <br>The WeChat group organized a series of chinese-speaking Webinars on the theme of climate resilience since October 2020, which is currently on its 15th issue. The webinar provides a live channel for Chinese researchers and students to follow and discuss international research progresses in the field of climate resilience.
  <br>Everyone with a WeChat account can request a membership to the group. Inquires shall be sent to <a href="klima.resilienz@gmail.com" target="_blank" class="navbar-item">
