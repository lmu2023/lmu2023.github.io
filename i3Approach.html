<h2>Approach</h2>
<h3>The innovation</h3>

<p>
STORIES proposes a resilience thinking (instead of risk thinking) in flood studies and investigates the social resilience to flood hazards with a historical perspective. It leads innovations in three aspects:
- Detecting the internal drivers and mechanisms of flood resilience in networked social systems
- Developing a new modeling tool of combined ABM and SNA for resilience studies
- Generating alternative resilience strategies to inform flood management

</p>
The project is composed of four work packages (WPs) as structured in the graph.
- WP1: Theoretical exploration on the scale effects of flood resilience
- WP2: Empirical case studies of flood resilience in the THR region
- WP3: Modelling the spatial-temporal dynamics of flood resilience in the THR region
- WP4: Transference and generalization of the research findings
With this integrative framework, the intention is to set up a theoretical basis in WP1 and test and further develop it through empirical case studies in WP2. WP3 focuses on developing agent-based models for specific cases and the general resilience dynamics across cases. WP4 aims to implement a full validation of findings in WP1 and WP2 with a case study in the Mekong River Delta, and a comparable agent-based model run (to WP3) in a different social and environmental context.
