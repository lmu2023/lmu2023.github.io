      <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:12px;line-height:120%">

  Dr. Yang is the Principal Investigator of the STORIES project and leads the independent research group of climate resilience at the Department of Geography, LMU Munich. Dr. Yang was educated in geography with focuses on land use planning and water system management in rural-urban systems, which formed the foundation of his research on long-term climate impacts and socio-ecosystem resilience. Household survey, stakeholder network analysis, agent-based model and geo-information systems are often applied in his studies. His research interests combine urbanization, climate risks and resilience building in developing Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia, South Asia and China. 
    <br>Dr. Yang holds a philosophy / ideology, that human societies have the capacity of resilience to live and develop better in a changing climate. And he investigates the “how”.
