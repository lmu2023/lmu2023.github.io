  Dr. Yang is the Principal Investigator of the STORIES project and leads the independent research group of climate resilience at the Department of Geography, LMU Munich. Dr. Yang was educated in geography with focuses on land use planning and water system management in rural-urban systems, which formed the foundation of his research on long-term climate impacts and socio-ecosystem resilience. Household survey, stakeholder network analysis, agent-based model and geo-information systems are often applied in his studies. His research interests combine urbanization, climate risks and resilience building in developing Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia, South Asia and China. 
    <br>Dr. Yang holds a philosophy / ideology, that human societies have the capacity of resilience to live and develop better in a changing climate. And he investigates the “how”.
    <br><br>Dr. Yang founded and manages the Google Group Climate Resilience (over 1500 members globally) and the WeChat Group Climate Resilience (about 650 members of Chinese-speaking). A series of Chinese-speaking webinars on the theme of climate resilience has been organized since October 2021, which is currently on its 15th issue.
    <br><br>Dr. Yang is a Senior Visiting Fellow at the Harvard University (10.2023-09.2024) ><a href="https://chinaproject.harvard.edu/people/liang-emlyn-yang" target="_blank" class="navbar-item">
