<h2>People</h2>

<p>
Existing studies on how societies deal with the issue of flooding overwhelmingly
concentrate on risk, exposure, vulnerability, damage, loss, and adaptation needs,
most of which adopt a negative perspective. Yet the populations living at coasts,
river deltas, flood plains, and hilly valleys – i.e. a wide variety of regions that
are potentially threatened by flooding – have not only survived, but actually prospered.
Despite many of such examples, there has been a dearth of systematic studies
undertaken on them. We wants to close this research gap and analyze
this form of societal resilience to flood hazards with a historical perspective.
